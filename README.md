Dev Assignment
****************************************

After taking clone please run "npm install" if using a linux system and got error like "no permission" please proceed with "sudo npm install" . this command should be run without the doule quotes.

one "npm install" executes successfully run "npm start" without the double quotes.

implemented the functional components for list view and redux and redux-thunk for state management.
redux-thunk is used as problem includes the async calling to the api and there is a need to create a middleware to implement redux.

if i got 4 more hours i would work on the lazy ans suspense loading as i couldnt find images in png/svg format from the api docs.

this problem can be improved if there are more combinations on the filter part of list view such as genere with pagination and genere with release date, etc.

i hope you find this helpfull.
